#Project: Investigating Netflix Movies

"""
Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into one of the largest entertainment and media companies.
1. Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex your exploratory data analysis skills and dive into the entertainment industry.

2. You work for a production company that specializes in nostalgic styles. You want to do some research on movies released in the 1990's. You'll delve into Netflix data and perform exploratory data analysis to better understand this awesome movie decade!

3. You have been supplied with the dataset netflix_data.csv, along with the following table detailing the column names and descriptions. Feel free to experiment further after submitting!
"""

# Importing pandas and matplotlib
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Read in the Netflix CSV as a DataFrame
netflix_df = pd.read_csv("netflix_data.csv")
netflix_df.head(10)

# Read in the Netflix CSV as a DataFrame
netflix_df = pd.read_csv("netflix_data.csv")

# Subset the DataFrame for type "Movie"
netflix_subset = netflix_df[netflix_df["type"] == "Movie"]

# Filter the to keep only movies released in between 1990s and 2000s
movies_1990s = netflix_subset[(netflix_subset["release_year"] >= 1990) & (netflix_subset["release_year"] < 2000)]

# Visualize the duration column of your filtered data to see the distribution of movie durations
# See which bar is the highest and save the duration value, this doesn't need to be exact!
plt.hist(movies_1990s["duration"], color='blue')
plt.title('Distribution of Movie Durations in the 1990s')
plt.xlabel('Duration (minutes)')
plt.ylabel('Number of Movies')
plt.show()

duration = 100

# Filter the data again to keep only the Action movies
action_movies_1990s = movies_1990s[movies_1990s["genre"] == "Action"]

# Use a for loop and a counter to count how many short action movies there were in the 1990s

# Start the counter
short_movie_count = 0

# Iterate over the labels and rows of the DataFrame and check if the duration is less than 90, if it is, add 1 to the counter, if it isn't, the counter should remain the same
for label, row in action_movies_1990s.iterrows():
    if row["duration"] < 90:
        short_movie_count = short_movie_count + 1
    else:
        short_movie_count = short_movie_count

print(short_movie_count)

# A quicker way of counting values in a column is to use .sum() on the desired column
# (action_movies_1990s["duration"] < 90).sum()
